# Library-Management-System

## Description
Booker is a web application that serves as a library management system; allowing its users to interact with a library by borrowing/purchasing books, enrolling in workshops, participating in signing events, and reviewing any entity of interest. Scrrenshots of different webpages are shown below.

In order for members to borrow books through our system, they will first use
our web application to reserve a book, which they can later pick up from the
library, provided that they do so before a set deadline which depends on their
membership status. Once they pick it up, the admin will change the status of the
book from “reserved” to “borrowed”. One should be careful and return their books on time, since warning will be assigned to any passed deadline, and can potentially cause penalties.
